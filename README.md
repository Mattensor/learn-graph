# Learn Graph

Welcome to learn graph, a nifty exemplar app to learn graphQL basics

## Tutorial

### About

GraphQL is a modern query language for your api.

It allows you to ask for anything you want in a single query and can make the domain easy to reason about.

</br>

### Philosophy

#### <u>Domain as a Graph</u>

Graphs often resemble our natural world models and they allow a common language to be used with everyone in organisation.

When working with GraphQL you want to model your business domain as a graph.
</br>
</br>

#### <u>Schema first</u>

You jump right into implimetation, adding feature after feature. Code is deployed to production and you have many consumers. Soon enough the domain doesn't represent the real world ðŸ”¥ and it becomes difficult to change.

Start with schema first. We design the dream query from the clients perspective and this should represent the real world domain. Then we can then dive into the implimentation.
